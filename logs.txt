}
Action: system.speak
P: {'speech': 'The square root of 16 is 4'}
R: None
Q: why did you multiply?
A: Ohh, Sorry about that. I got confused about the operation. The correct operation for getting the square root of 16 is to use the `math.sqrt` function which is not one of the available commands in our system constraints.
Q: why did you set the params as four and dour
A: I apologize for the mistake. I set the params as "4" and "4" because the square root of 16 is 4 multiplied by 4 which gives a result of 16. However, this was incorrect as the operation for finding the square root of 16 is not multiplication but rather the `math.sqrt` function.

Q: can you make that time in 12 hr time
A: I'm sorry but I don't have an inbuilt functionality to convert military(Hours are 24-hour format) time to a 12-hour time.
Q: can you try
A: I'm afraid there is no predefined command to convert military time to 12-hour time. However, we can compute the 12-hour time using the modulo operator from the demo_skills.divide command. 

Please provide the current time in military format beginning with "Time is...".
