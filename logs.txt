        }
    }
}
Action: system.speak
P: {'speech': 'The square root of 16 is 4'}
R: None
Q: why did you multiply?
A: Ohh, Sorry about that. I got confused about the operation. The correct operation for getting the square root of 16 is to use the `math.sqrt` function which is not one of the available commands in our system constraints.
Q: why did you set the params as four and dour
A: I apologize for the mistake. I set the params as "4" and "4" because the square root of 16 is 4 multiplied by 4 which gives a result of 16. However, this was incorrect as the operation for finding the square root of 16 is not multiplication but rather the `math.sqrt` function.

Q: can you make that time in 12 hr time
A: I'm sorry but I don't have an inbuilt functionality to convert military(Hours are 24-hour format) time to a 12-hour time.
Q: can you try
A: I'm afraid there is no predefined command to convert military time to 12-hour time. However, we can compute the 12-hour time using the modulo operator from the demo_skills.divide command. 

Please provide the current time in military format beginning with "Time is...".

A: I apologize for the confusion. In that case, you may consider adding the following code snippet after the recognizer.recognize_google(audio) function to stop the recognizer from continually listening:

```
recognizer_instance_instance_instance.adjust_for_ambient_noise(audio_source, duration=0.5)
recognizer_instance_instance_instance.pause_threshold = 0.5
recognizer_instance_instance_instance.phrase_threshold = 0.5
recognizer_instance_instance_instance.non_speaking_duration = 0.5
``` 

The `adjust_for_ambient_noise` function sets a signal/silence threshold, while the `pause_threshold` sets the amount of quiet time after speech before the recognizer considers the audio input to be complete, the `phrase_threshold` sets the minimum length of the audio input that constitutes acceptable speech and the `non_speaking_duration` sets maximum length of time (in seconds) that the recognizer will wait for additional speech to follow after detecting some possible speech. You can adjust the values as needed.
